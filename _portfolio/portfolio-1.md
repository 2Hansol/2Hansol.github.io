Task: Face Reenactment
Motivation: Previous methods suffered from large pose changes or very different face shapes in cross-identity reenactment.
Approach: I propose a method to preserve the unseen parts of the source image through well-generated 3D face images to generate high-quality results in cross-identity reenactment.
