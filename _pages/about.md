Research Interests
======
 Computer vision based on deep learning related to humans (e.g. Face reenactment, 3D avatar reconstruction, etc.)


Education
======
B.S. in Economics, Sookmyung Women’s University, 2021

B.S. in Computer Science, Sookmyung Women’s University, 2021

M.S. in Computer Engineering, Ulsan national institute of science and technology, 2023

Projects
======
* IFaceUV: Intuitive Motion Facial Image Generation by Identity Preservation via UV map
  * I participated in the project of Institute for Information  communication Technology Planning & evaluation(IITP).
  * The goal of the project is the development of face image synthesis algorithms that has the same characteristics as the person up to the level below the cognitive threshold.
